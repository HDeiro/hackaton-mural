# mural-integrations-sample

Welcome to our sample app!

## Setup

To get started as quickly as possible using this sample app, you can use Mailinator credentials in the default setup. 
More information about setting up a Mailinator email account can be found here:
https://mural.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PDE/pages/2177925284/Apps+Ahoy+Hackathon+-+Production+testing+of+the+public+api

Once you have set up your Mailinator account, be sure to install dependencies using the below command:

```shell
npm install
```

## Applications

This application is split into 2 parts:

 - an OAuth Server for authenticating
 - a `create-react-app` application

### OAuth Server

the OAuth server can be started by running the following command:

```shell
npm run start:server
```

This will kick off the oauth server on port `5000` and allow you to do authentication calls.

The default scopes requested by the application are:

 - murals:read 
 - murals:write
 - rooms:read
 - workspaces:read
 - identity:read

However, all scopes can be used by this sample app:

The settings for this server are stored in the [config/defaults.json](./config/defaults.json) file, and can be 
overridden by creating a `config/local.json` file that follows the same structure.

The oauth application itself runs from the [server.ts](./server.ts) file.

### React App

The React app was made using [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/documentation-intro) and can be 
started by running the following command:

```shell
npm run start:client
```

This will begin running the client application on port `4000` which is set in the [.env](./.env) file.

Remember, these settings can be overridden with a  `.env.local` file.

The [entry point](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/#entry) for this application is [src/index.tsx](./src/index.tsx) and 
the main App is in [src/App.tsx](./src/App.tsx)


### `clientConfig.fetchFn()`

By default, this app's functionality is running tests to ensure workspaces and rooms are able to fetch murals.

If you want to change or add to this behavior by making your own calls to the API, you can use the app's built-in 
implementation of [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API), which automatically takes care 
of OAuth (by appending your token to each request for you).

To get this working, you must call the following method before you attempt to call any APIs:

```javascript
import startAuth from "./setupAPI.js";

startAuth().then((isAuthorized) => {
  if(isAuthorized){
    ReactDom.render(
        // your <App /> here
    )
  }
})
```

Setting this up will enable you to use the following method to hit MURAL endpoints from anywhere within your app:

```javascript
import {clientConfig} from "./setupAPI.js";

// Very cool app code

clientConfig.fetchFn('https://app.mural.co/api/public/v1')  // endpoint URI goes here
    .then(response=>{
      // Cool code that creatively processes data returned from MURAL API ðŸ˜Ž
    })
```

`clientConfig.fetchFn` replicates the interface for the [`fetch` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/fetch)
The signature for `clientConfig.fetchFn` is identical to that of [`fetch` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/fetch), 
with the additional feature of automatically refreshing the token for you, which means you don't have to implement this 
on your own.
